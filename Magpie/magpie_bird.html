    <h1>Magpie</h1>

    <p>The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) is a medium-sized black and white bird native to New Zealand and southern New Guinea.</p>
    <p>There are three subspecies of magpie in New Zealand including both black-backed and white-backed magpies, that were introduced to New Zealand from the 1860s to control pests in pastures.</p>
    <p>They are now spread through much of the two main islands of the country.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Magpies taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria in Australia were introduced to New Zealand by settlers of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s.</p>
    <p>The Wellington Acclimatisation Society released 260 birds in 1874.</p>
    <p>Originally they were introduced to control agricultural pests, and were even a protected species until 1951!</p>
    <p>They are now widespread in both the North and South Islands, but are more common in the North Island.</p>

    <h2>Identification</h2>

    <p>Magpies are large birds, measuring 37 to 43 cm in length and weighing 250 to 350 g.</p>
    <p>They have a distinctive black and white plumage, with a white back and black wings and tail.</p>
    <p>They have a long, straight bill and strong legs, which they use for foraging and digging.</p>
    <p>Magpies are known for their loud, melodious calls, which can be heard throughout the day.</p>
