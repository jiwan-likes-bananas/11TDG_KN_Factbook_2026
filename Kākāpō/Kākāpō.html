    <h2>- A breif history of the Kāpāpō</h2>
    <div class="history">
    <div>
    <ul>
    <li>14th Century: Polynesian settlers (Māori) arrived, using kākāpō for food and feathers. The birds, being flightless, were easy prey, leading to a drop in population.</li>
    <li>19th Century (European Settlement): European settlers introduced cats, dogs, and rats, which devastated the remaining population. Thousands of birds were also collected for museums and zoos, most of which died.</li>
    <li>1894: The New Zealand government made its first attempt to save the species, appointing Richard Henry as caretaker for Resolution Island, which was ultimately unsuccessful.</li>
    <li>1974–1977: A small, remnant population of only males was found in Fiordland, leading to the belief that the species was nearly lost.</li>
    <li>1977: A surprising, separate population of about 200 birds was discovered on Stewart Island, though it was still under threat from cats.</li>
    <li>Present day: Due to intemse managment by the department consevactioin the speices numbers have recoverd, unforunatly they are still an endangered speices</li>
